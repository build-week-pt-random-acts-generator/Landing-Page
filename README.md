# Landing-Page
A place to build out the landing page (marketing page).

Proposal

 People want to do good and serve others, but it's just so hard to remember to do it. Even if you remember, it's hard to think of a service idea on the spot. Random acts generator solves both problems by reminding you to serve- randomly choosing a person from your contacts, and giving you suggestions for how to serve them.
